# TapTaze â€“ Greengrocer Web Application

**TapTaze** is a dynamic and user-friendly **e-greengrocer** web application developed using **React.js** for the frontend and **Spring Boot (Java)** for the backend. The platform enables seamless online grocery shopping through an intuitive interface designed with a modern user experience in mind.

###  Key Features

-  Role-based panel system with three separate interfaces:
    - **User Panel:** Allows customers to browse and search products, manage their personal information, create and update their cart and favorites, track their order status, and download detailed order invoices in a printable format.
    - **Manager Panel:** Handles stock control, shipping processes, discount management, and user messages.
    - **Admin Panel:** Manages product details, updates, and administrative-level operations.

The system is designed with flexibility and modularity in mind, supporting dynamic updates and scalable functionality. Whether you're a shopper or a system manager, TapTaze adapts to your needs.

## MySQL Database Setup

This project uses a MySQL database for persistent data storage.

### Instructions:

2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL server.
3. Create a new schema named: `greengrocer_db`.

5. After that, populate the database using the provided SQL script:

ðŸ“‚ [`backend/sql/setup.sql`](backend/sql/setup.sql)

### Requirements:

* Redis installed and running locally
* A valid Sendinblue API Key
* A verified sender email address

### Setup Instructions:

1. In the project root directory, locate the file named `.env.example`.
2. Make a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`
3. Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```env
MAIL_API_KEY=your-sendinblue-api-key
SENDER_EMAIL=your-verified-email@example.com
```

> ðŸ“Œ Your Sendinblue account must have a verified sender address that matches `SENDER_EMAIL`.
